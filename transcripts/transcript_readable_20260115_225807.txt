SESSION: COMMUNICATION
Structure: LLM with Triggers
======================================================================

Patient A:
You know, I think our biggest issue is that we both get stuck in these same old patterns.
Like, I feel like whenever I try to talk to you about something that's bothering me, it always turns into a fight.
I don't understand why it has to be that way.
I get frustrated because it feels like you're not listening, and then I probably just shut down.
I know that's not helpful, but it's like I don't know how else to deal with it.
I want us to actually hear each other, but I don't know if we're even speaking the same language sometimes.

AI_Facilitator:
It sounds like you're both feeling unheard and stuck in a cycle that's frustrating for both of you.
Let's take a step back and try to focus on what each of you truly wants to express.
Perhaps we can explore a way to communicate these feelings without it escalating into an argument.

Patient A:
You know, it's tough because I really do want to listen and be there for you, but sometimes it feels like we're just talking past each other.
I don’t know if it’s the way I say things or if I just pick the wrong moments, but it seems like it always spirals.
I hate feeling like I'm walking on eggshells, but I also hate shutting down and closing off.
Maybe we need some kind of code word or something to hit pause before things get heated.
I just want us to find a way to talk without it turning into a battle every time.

AI_Facilitator:
It sounds like you're both really committed to improving your communication and that's a great first step.
I appreciate your idea of using a code word to pause when things feel heated—it's a practical tool to help you both feel safe and heard.
Let's explore together how you might implement this in a way that feels comfortable for both of you.

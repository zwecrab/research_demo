My ex and I, we don't see eye to eye on so many things, especially when it comes to the kids and finances. It feels like I'm constantly trying to keep peace while walking on eggshells. And I can't help but feel guilty about how all this impacts the kids. They didn't ask for any of this, and I worry about them all the time.

I sometimes feel caught in the middle, trying to support you but also manage my own feelings about all this. I'm worried too, especially about the kids and how all these tensions might be affecting them. I know it's important to stay positive about the exes, especially in front of the kids, but it's tough when emotions run high. I guess I just wish we had a clearer plan or some way to untangle all these financial and parenting issues. It does feel overwhelming some days.

I hate the idea of them picking up on any tension, but it's hard to keep it all under wraps.

I think starting small is smart; maybe we can tackle one issue at a time, like figuring out a better schedule or getting on the same page financially.

I want to be able to talk things through without feeling like we're walking on eggshells. Maybe if we can work on setting some clear boundaries and expectations with them, things might feel a bit more manageable. I also think it’s crucial we keep our conversations about these issues between us private. The kids have enough on their plates without being dragged into adult stuff. If we start with this, maybe everything else will start to fall into place a little more easily."

Keeping conversations private and away from the kids is an excellent way to protect them from unnecessary stress. I'm curious about how you might go about establishing these boundaries and expectations with your ex-partners.

I agree that setting boundaries with the exes would help reduce some of the tension. Honestly, I sometimes feel overwhelmed trying to juggle everyone's needs, and I worry if we can actually get everyone on board with clearer communication. But I'm hopeful. Maybe we can start by having a calm conversation with them about what we need, like sticking to schedules and not involving the kids in adult issues.

I get what you're saying about having a plan and being hopeful, Rachel, and I appreciate your optimism. But it's scary, you know? The thought of having to sit down and set these boundaries with the exes is daunting. I just worry about how they'll react and whether it'll end up making things more complicated.

I mean, we're doing this for the kids, right? It might be tough at first, but having a clear plan could really help us manage things better and keep the peace.

The biggest challenge, though, might be all those unexpected things that come up, especially with our exes. It’s like every time we plan something, there’s a new curveball. I guess we’ll have to really back each other up, especially when it comes to dealing with the ex-partners. Maybe we can figure out a way to handle those surprises without letting them throw off our plans. It’s not easy, but supporting each other is probably the only way we’ll keep it going."

I agree that having a set day for family nights could really help us create a sense of stability and unity. But you're right—the unexpected stuff with our exes can really throw us off. I think if we can find a way to handle those surprises together, without letting them derail us, it could make a big difference. Maybe we can come up with a strategy for how to deal with those curveballs when they come. It feels like if we're on the same page and backing each other up, we'll be better equipped to handle whatever comes our way. And that stability will hopefully trickle down to the kids."

It's like, we're trying to do our best here, but then something pops up with our exes, and it feels like we're back at square one. I do think having those family nights could be our little anchor, something predictable in the chaos. Maybe we can make a list or something of what needs handling each week, so when those curveballs come, we're not completely blindsided. It's not gonna be perfect, but if we can tackle these things together, maybe we can keep the focus where it should be—on the kids and us."

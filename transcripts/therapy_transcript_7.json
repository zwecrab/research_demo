I understand that you're here to explore feelings of jealousy that have been affecting your relationship. My hope for our time together is to create a supportive space where you both can express yourselves openly and work towards understanding these feelings better.\n\nTo start, I'd like to hear from each of you about how jealousy has been showing up in your relationship and what you'd like to achieve through our sessions.

I know it’s been tough on both of us, and maybe it's even harder on you, but I have my moments too where it just feels overwhelming. Sometimes, I feel like I’m walking on eggshells, not wanting to trigger anything, but also feeling like my own needs are getting lost in the process. I really want us to get through this because I love you and I believe in us, but it’s been hard to find the right balance.

It’s like, I trust you and everything, but then these feelings hit me out of nowhere and I'm just... stuck. I hate that it makes you feel like you’re walking on eggshells. I don’t want us to tiptoe around each other. I guess I'm also trying to figure out where it all comes from and why it’s so strong sometimes. I'm definitely hoping we can figure out better ways to talk about this, without it feeling so loaded. I just want to get to a place where we both feel seen and heard, you know?"

I love you, and seeing this issue between us is something I struggle with too; it’s not like I have all the answers. There are moments when I question what I could be doing differently, and it's confusing. Sometimes, I worry that I’m not getting it right or that maybe I’m not understanding enough when those feelings come up for you. I guess I’m just hoping we can find some clarity together.

I don't want to put the burden of my insecurities on you. I know you're doing your best, and I appreciate your patience.

But being open with each other, even if it's messy, seems like the right move. I really want us to feel solid and like we’re in this together.

As for starting, maybe kicking things off with some simple check-ins, like how our week's been or what's been on our minds. That way, we can ease into more serious stuff without it feeling forced or awkward. I'm really hopeful that doing this will help us feel more like partners in all of this.

It's okay if things get a bit messy; it shows we're trying, right? I do get anxious about the jealousy stuff, especially when I feel like I can't measure up or that you might be pulling away.

The idea of having scheduled times to talk feels like it could help, like a little anchor in our week where we know we’re both present and committed. The thought of opening up about what’s been on our minds, even the heavy stuff, feels intimidating, but I also see how it can really help us understand each other better. I guess I'm hopeful too.

Like, I can tell you when I'm feeling those insecurities bubble up instead of keeping it to myself. I guess hearing from you that you're still invested and that we're in this together could help ease my worries a bit.

I'm here to learn more about what brings you both here today.\n\nI understand that you've been experiencing a sense of loss when it comes to love and affection in your relationship. This can be a difficult space to be in, and it’s important to acknowledge the courage it takes to address these feelings.\n\nTogether, we can explore what might have contributed to this change and how it’s impacting each of you. My hope is to create a safe environment where we can understand these dynamics better and work towards rekindling the connection you once felt. \n\nTo start, I'm curious about what each of you feels has shifted recently"

It's just that sometimes I feel like we're living more like roommates than partners. I miss the little things we used to do for each other, like spontaneous hugs or just sitting together without distractions. I know life has been hectic, and maybe we've gotten lost in the day-to-day stuff. It's hard because I want to fix things, but I don't always know how.

I miss those moments too—the ones where we didn't have to think, just felt connected. It's hard not to feel like we're drifting when everything else seems to demand our attention. I guess I've been trying to hold it together by just pushing through, but maybe that's part of the problem. I want to find our way back too, but honestly, I'm scared because I don't know where to start. I guess being here is a start, right?

I get what you mean about routines taking over—it's like we're on autopilot. I miss the spontaneity and the little gestures that made us feel close. I know life gets busy, but I don't want us to lose what makes us \"us.\" I guess this is how we start, by admitting we're scared and unsure, but still willing to try. I just want us to be more intentional about finding time for each other, even if it's just small things at first. What do you think?"

I want to be more intentional about it, but I guess I'm just scared of messing it up or not knowing how to start. Maybe we can try something small, like setting aside a night just for us, no phones, no distractions. I'm not sure if it'll fix everything, but at least it's a step, right?"

I think, for me, it was about feeling seen and appreciated, like Tyler was thinking about me even when we weren't together. It was those unexpected moments that kind of reminded us that we were more than just roommates passing each other by. I don't want to sound cheesy, but those things reminded me why I fell in love with Tyler in the first place. I guess if we start with something simple, like a dedicated night for just us, it could bring some of that back. It's a bit scary, but I really think it's worth trying."

I agree, starting with something simple like a dedicated night just for us sounds like a good idea. It's a bit intimidating to think about how to bring all that back, but I really want to try. I guess I'm worried about whether we can make it last this time, but knowing we're both committed to trying makes it feel possible. Let's start small and see where it takes us."

I guess starting small is less overwhelming, right? Like, we don't have to fix everything overnight. Maybe we could plan a simple dinner or something, just to see how it feels. I'm hopeful, but also a bit nervous. I just want to make sure we don't slip back into old patterns once we start. But if we're both committed, I think we can do it"

But I'm committed to trying, and I think the fact that we're both here, talking about this, shows we're already taking steps in the right direction.

I know it's easy to fall back into routines, but maybe if we make a point to be more present with each other, we can avoid that. I'm definitely up for brainstorming some ideas—maybe even something as simple as a note in the morning or a surprise coffee run.

It's like, if we can just keep those little moments alive, maybe it'll help break up the daily grind that seems to pull us apart. But, honestly, I do worry about slipping back into old habits, like getting so caught up in our routines that we forget to make time for each other.

The idea of setting aside time—maybe like a weekly date night or even just a walk—sounds really nice to me. I get worried too about falling back into old patterns, but maybe we can remind each other gently if it happens. I think if we both stay open and honest about needing that time, it could help us feel closer and more connected. It’s a bit daunting, but also exciting to think about finding our rhythm again.

The idea of setting aside regular time together sounds good, but I gotta admit, part of me is anxious about it. I’m worried that we might start strong and then life will just... take over again. Maybe we can come up with a simple reminder system or something to keep us accountable? Like, I don’t know, a note on the fridge or a calendar alert? I want to make sure we prioritize this because, honestly, I miss us. I'm hopeful, but I just need a little reassurance that we’re both committed to making this work."

I like the idea of a reminder system, something simple to keep us on track. A note on the fridge or a calendar alert sounds like a good start.

I do too, even if it doesn't always come across that way. Maybe we can start by planning something small for this weekend, just to get into the groove of it.

I guess the idea is a bit nerve-wracking because I worry about disappointing Tyler or myself if things don't go perfectly.

I think that's what I miss the most—those spontaneous moments where we just enjoy each other’s company. I get nervous too, about messing things up, but maybe that's okay.
